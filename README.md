# Persinate

Persinate is a Java library and a Maven plugin that enable programmers to generate Hibernate entities from XML files during build.
It facilitates data audit as it automatically creates corresponding historic entities. See [persinate-example](./persinate-example) for more details.

## Structure
* `persinate-core` is a module that should be imported by each module that uses or contains entities generated by Persinate.
* `persinate-maven` is the Maven plugin that makes the magic happen. It is hooked on the `generate-sources` phase and generates Java entities.
* `persinate-generator-lib` contains all the code generation logic.
* `persinate-example` is a small Spring module containing unit tests and code examples.

## Current state
Persinate is in a very early stage of development. It lacks documentation and JavaDocs, the event listeners seem to not work.
Feel free to review the code and suggest improvements.
